This isn't just another run-of-the-mill services company that does\n          the same old development for hire. We have a reputation for being able to solve hard problems well, which attracts good customers with good work. We typically do consulting work\n          work with a product mindset (we're in the middle of building two products right now and have launched a third product in the past). We are small, but growing so there is plenty of room for you to have an impact.\n        </p>\n        <p>Other things to keep in mind about working with us:</p>\n        <div class=\"container mx-auto px-12 mt-4 mb-4\">\n          <ul class=\"list-disc\">\n            <li><b>100% remote - </b> we are a remote first company started by people that have been working remotely for years. We know how to build a happy, functioning\n              remote working culture. You are free to live where you like as long as you have good overlap in working hours with the team.</li>\n            <li><b>Work life boundaries - </b> we organize the company so that you can work clear, reasonable hours and then live your life. There are no expectations\n              that you constantly check your email or Slack while you are not at work (you can view our <a href=\"https://bigbadwolfsecurity.notion.site/Deep-Work-and-Tools-cd4dc29abdb94d4ab8cdcd63c4692d40\">actual company policy</a>\n              on encouraging deep work, avoiding distractions, and maintaining work separation). No gimmicks like unlimited vacation: you know what vacation time you have and are free to take that time. We all work hard while at work and then enjoy the rest of our lives.</li>\n            <li><b>Great coworkers - </b> life is too short to work with jerks, so we have a strict no jerk policy. We also have an interesting group of people that use their non-work\n              time well, whether that's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AdamPryorOfficial\">playing music</a> or <a href=\"https://www.thecantelope.com/\">sustainable farming</a>.</li>\n            <li><b>Generous benefits - </b>we offer 100% employer paid health, dental, vision, 401k, and generous paid time off.</li>\n          </ul>\n        </div>\n        <p>Unfortunately, because some of our work is for the U.S. government we are only hiring U.S. Citizens living in the U.S. at the moment.

This is a unique opportunity to build\n            a desktop-focused Linux product with a great tech stack: KVM, libvirt, rust, rpm-ostree. We are a small team of very experienced Linux developers\n            looking to add another developer that will work on both development and test automation, including test as part of continuos integration. Automating the testing\n            of this particular product is going to be challenging, so this should have some fun technical challenges beyond the normal test automation. Experience we are looking for:\n          </p>\n          <div class=\"container mx-auto px-12 mt-4 mb-4\">\n            <ul class=\"list-disc\">\n              <li><b>Linux - </b> in-depth understanding and experience with Linux development, packaging, and how distributions are built. Sort of \"full-stack\" Linux\n                development. This project will both write all of the application code, but also package that into an installable RHEL-based distribution and provide\n                updates. So it's crucial that you be able to contribute to all aspects of that process. Your experience doesn't have to be with Red Hat based\n                distros, though that would be great.</li>\n              <li><b>Software Development - </b>this is ultimately a software development role, so you need to be a strong developer. Most of the new code will be in Rust,\n                so experience with Rust is welcome, but experience with other compiled, statically typed languages is fine. Much of the development will be \"systems\n                programming\", so knowledge and experience with low-level operating system details is helpful. But there is also going to be user interface development,\n                scripting, and other bits to bring the whole system together, so a breadth of experience is welcome.</li>\n              <li><b>Test Automation - </b>this role is split between development and development in test, meaning test automation will be an important aspect of the role. The test \n              automation will be both for the Linux desktop product itself and a range of connected infrastructure, which will include Linux, Windows, and networking infrastructure, so \n              general IT knowledge and experience with a range of platforms is required.</li>\n              <li><b>Security - </b> this is a security product (the virtualization is being used to provide separation and data confidentiality), so some experience\n                with security fundamentals is helpful. At a minimum, knowledge of secure coding practices and basic Linux access control is required. Knowledge of other aspects of security is a plus\n                (encryption, advanced access control, secure design). A strong desire to learn more about security is a must.</li>\n              <li><b>Good writing skills - </b>creating good documentation is part of the core principles of the project. You don't have to be Shakespeare, but you need\n                to be able to write clearly.</li>\n            </ul>\n          </div>\n          <p>For this Linux Developer / Developer in Test position we are targeting someone with at least 3 - 4 years of experience, but are open to more experienced developers (and\n            welcome older developers in general).\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"mt-4\">\n          <p>\n            <p><b>Lead Software QA / Documentation</b></p>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Help build a Linux desktop secure virtualization product that will be deployed to tens of thousands of users.

We are a small team of very experienced Linux developers\n            looking to add quality assurance professional that can also help create the technical documentation. This is a unique role - we are looking for a creative QA person that\n            can use their attention to detail and clear communication skills to help also deliver a large package of formal documentation.

You will be creating the test plans\n              from scratch from developer documentation and descriptions, so this is an opportunity to do things right from the start, but it also means that you need to have a strong understanding\n              of how to structure testing to ensure software quality. You also need to understand how to balance the use of test automation and manual testing for cost of development and execution.</li>\n              <li><b>Linux, Windows, and Networking - </b> at least some experience with Linux, Windows, and basic networking to aid with debugging and test creation.</li>\n              <li><b>Security - </b> this is a security product (the virtualization is being used to provide separation and data confidentiality), so some experience\n                with security fundamentals is helpful.
